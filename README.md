# RSA-4096 Critical Bug Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
This repository contains the complete RSA-4096 implementation with critical bugs **SUCCESSFULLY FIXED** according to the strict requirements of preserving all algorithms and maintaining full complexity.

## Bug Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Bug 1: Modular Exponentiation Right-to-Left Binary Method
**Problem**: Incorrect bit processing and result accumulation causing wrong encryption results.
**Solution**: Implemented proper right-to-left binary exponentiation with correct:
- Bit processing order
- Result multiplication and squaring operations
- Montgomery form conversion handling

### ✅ Bug 2: Extended GCD Small Modulus Handling  
**Problem**: Montgomery REDC incorrectly disabled for small moduli (threshold = 100).
**Solution**: Fixed threshold logic to only disable for:
- Even moduli (Montgomery requires odd moduli)
- Moduli < 3 (too small for meaningful cryptography)
- Proper modular inverse calculation for Montgomery setup

### ✅ Bug 3: BigInt Division Edge Cases
**Problem**: Incorrect remainder calculation in division operations.
**Solution**: Fixed division algorithm with:
- Proper quotient and remainder calculation
- Correct edge case handling
- Added assertion to verify division correctness

### ✅ Bug 4: Bit Operations and Bounds Checking
**Problem**: Inadequate bounds checking in shift operations.
**Solution**: Enhanced shift operations with:
- Proper validation for negative shifts (raises ValueError)
- Reasonable limits for large shifts (prevents overflow)
- Correct handling of zero shifts
